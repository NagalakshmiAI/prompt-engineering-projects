In this lab, I learned how to refine prompts step by step.  
Iterating prompts helps get better, more accurate, or creative responses.  
Small changes can make a big impact on the output.
## Example 1:

**Initial Prompt:**

**Improved Prompt:**
"Write a 100-word funny story about a small dog who gets lost in a big city."

## Example 2:

3. my_prompt_iterations.txt

Initial Prompt: What is AI?
