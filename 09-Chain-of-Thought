Input:
"If a leaf falls from a tree in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?"
Prompt:
Use chain-of-thought reasoning to answer the question.
Output:
"To determine if a sound is made, we must understand what sound is. Sound is a vibration that travels through the air. Whether or not a person hears it, the vibration still occurs, so yes, it does make a sound."
