| 01     | Introduction to Prompts      | Understand what prompt engineering is and its value. |
| 02     | Zero-Shot and Few-Shot       | Learn the difference and use cases of zero-shot and few-shot prompting. |
| 03     | Summarizing Text             | Practice writing prompts that summarize content effectively. |
| 04     | Classifying Intent           | Design prompts to extract or classify user intent from text. |
| 05     | Extracting Information       | Write prompts that pull structured data from unstructured input. |
| 06     | Expanding Text               | Use prompts to creatively expand short text into detailed content. |
| 07     | Inferring Intent             | Go deeper into understanding user intent from context. |
| 08     | Transforming Tone            | Modify the tone of a message (e.g., professional ↔ casual). |
| 09     | Chain-of-Thought Reasoning   | Apply multi-step reasoning with intermediate steps. |
| 10     | Improving Responses          | Refine short or unclear model responses into helpful ones. |
| 11     | Evaluating Responses         | Analyze prompt outputs and determine which is most helpful. |
