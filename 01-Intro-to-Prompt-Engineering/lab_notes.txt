Prompt Engineering is the process of crafting inputs that guide an AI model like ChatGPT.
There are various techniques like zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting.
This lab explains how to write effective prompts for better responses from AI models.
Lab 01: Introduction to Prompt Engineering

1. Prompt Engineering is the art of designing effective inputs for AI models.
2. Key techniques include:
   - Zero-shot prompting
   - Few-shot prompting
   - Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting
3. Effective prompts should be:
   - Clear and specific
   - Structured logically
   - Tailored to the model's capabilities
4. Prompt testing is important to compare different output styles.
5. Even small wording changes can affect AI behavior drastically.
6. Prompt engineering is critical in real-world AI tasks like summarization, QA, and creativity tools.

This lab gave an overview of prompt styles and how they influence AI output. Understanding this helps build better AI tools and user experiences.
