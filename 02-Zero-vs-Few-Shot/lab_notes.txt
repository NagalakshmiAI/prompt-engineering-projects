Lab 02: Zero-Shot vs Few-Shot Prompting

1. Zero-shot prompting gives the model a task with no examples.
2. Few-shot prompting includes 1â€“3 examples to guide the model.
3. Few-shot often improves accuracy for complex tasks.
4. Key takeaway: The model performs better when shown patterns.
5. Used in classification, translation, and reasoning tasks.
6. Few-shot prompts should be carefully selected to guide model output quality.
